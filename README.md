# `<Dropperx/>` üìÅ‚úä
Wrap any function-as-child component to turn it into a [React Drag-n-Drop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dnd) target that reads the contents of files. A _prescribed_  method for reading files in the browser.

#### Usage:
```javascript
import Dropperx from 'dropperx'

// inside component tree
<Dropperx
  onDrop={files => this.setState({ files })}
  filter={file => file.size < 10000 && file.type === 'image/png')}
>
  {
    ({ isOver, canDrop, files, history }) => (
      <Overlay
        isOver={isOver || canDrop}
        title={`Drop your files here to import ${isOver ? '‚úã' : '‚úä'}`}
      >
        <Upload filesContents={files.map(file => file.content)} />
        {
          history.map(bundle => (
            <li>bundle</li>
          ))
        }
      </Overlay>
    )
  }
</Dropperx>
```
**Note**: your instance of `Dropperx` must be within a `react-dnd` [`DragDropContext` ](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/docs-drag-drop-context.html)

## Props
- `onDrop(files)`: Callback called with an array of files dropped. Get the contents of the file from `files[0].content`
- `filter`: Function passed to `files.filter(filter)`. Lets you control which files are read.

## Child Callback Function
The function you pass into `Dropperx` is called with a single object containing these keys:
- `isOver`: Boolean that says whether cursor is over the target
- `canDrop`: Boolean that states if able to drop on the window. This is true if the cursor is holding files
- `files`: Array of files that were last dropped. `null` if nothing has been dropped.
- `history`: Array of past dropped contents. `history[0]` contains the array of files last dropped.
- `__monitor__`: Escape hatch to access the React-DnD monitor object
